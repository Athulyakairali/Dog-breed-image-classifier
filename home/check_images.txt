Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures correctly classified Dog_01.jpg as 'pug'.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The two models correctly identified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as 'pug'.According to the second model, Dog_01.jpg represents a pug, and Dog_02.jpg a bull mastiff.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: The three model architectures properly categorised the item image as a "coffee mug" and recognized it as not being a dog. 


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:The two models identified correctly 75% of images. Both were wrong in the identification of the breed of the cat  which they classified as  'tiger cat', respectively. Nonetheless, both models identified the cat as such, and did not mistake it for a dog. Overall, the best-performing model architecture for this task was ResNet, because of its runtime of 00:00:03. Indeed, VGG took twice the time to complete the task, 00:00:06.
